üìà SEGMENT PERFORMANCE:
* **Automotive (ATV)** revenue increased by **6% sequentially** to **EUR 1,858 million**, driven by the **underlying improvement of inventory digestion** by customers.
* **Green Industrial Power (GIP)** revenue increased by **17% quarter-over-quarter** to **EUR 397 million**, driven by **contributions from all application areas** hinting at a **gradual recovery of industrial markets**.
* **Power & Sensor Systems (PSS)** revenue was **essentially flat** at **EUR 979 million**, driven by **continued strong growth momentum for power solutions for AI servers** offset by **expected price downs in most consumer-related applications**.
* **Connected Secure Systems (CSS)** revenue increased by **3% sequentially** to **EUR 356 million**, driven by **higher revenues and some structural effects**.

‚ùì KEY ANALYST Q&A:
* Q: What are the mechanics behind the revised full-year margin guidance, specifically regarding gross margin, OpEx, and pricing pressure? A: The revised guidance to mid-teens segment result margin, with gross margin around 40%, is due to volume reduction leading to higher underutilization charges, a significant currency headwind of approximately EUR 400 million in revenue and EUR 150-170 million in segment result for the second half, and price reductions in certain standard power components on the industrial side.
* Q: What is the assumption for the tariff-induced revenue reduction in the September quarter, and how is it impacting the outlook? A: Management assumes a 10% revenue haircut for Q4, translating to approximately EUR 400 million, as a guesstimate for derisking the guidance. This is not based on mathematical calculation or current order book changes, but rather a proactive measure against tariff uncertainty.
* Q: How is Infineon addressing ongoing price pressure in the GIP (General Industrial Power) segment, particularly from Chinese competitors in power discretes like IGBTs and SiC? A: Infineon differentiates by focusing on high-reliability modules (e.g., for ESS and transmission) and maintaining a 1-2 generation lead in SiC MOSFET and silicon MOSFET technology. While standard power components may face pressure, the company's strength in high-performance and high-reliability applications, especially in automotive (double-digit growth in China), mitigates the overall impact.
* Q: Are the AI revenue targets of EUR 600 million for the current year and EUR 1 billion for next year still on track despite FX fluctuations? A: Yes, Infineon confirms the EUR 600 million AI revenue target for the current year and the EUR 1 billion target for next year. The company is actively powering AI from 'grid to core,' optimizing power efficiency and density in data centers, and is gaining market share in this growing segment.

üîç DETAILED ANALYST Q&A:
* Q from Didier Scemama - Bank of America: My first question, maybe for Sven, on the margin guidance for the full year, the revision from mid to high teens to mid-teens. I just wanted to understand the mechanics a little bit because, obviously, you were not quite there when you were guiding at $1.10 before. So I just wanted to understand gross margin, you said adjusted about 40%. Are there any specific elements in OpEx that we should be mindful of? Or are you seeing more pricing pressure perhaps that would warrant the lower segment results margin? A: Gross margin remains around **40%**. The revision is due to a certain **volume reduction** leading to higher **underutilization charges**, a significant **currency effect** (EUR 0.075 from $1.05 to $1.125 translates to ~**EUR 400 million revenue headwind** and **EUR 150-170 million segment result headwind** for H2), and **price reductions** in certain standard power components on the industrial side.
* Q from Didier Scemama - Bank of America: For my follow-up, I just wanted to also understand a little bit to guesstimate on the tariff-induced reduction. So what are you assuming for the September quarter for the various divisions? Are you expecting, for instance, automotive to decline sequentially? Or if you could help us understand a little bit where the haircut is coming from? A: It's a "guesstimate" with no mathematical calculation. A **10% haircut for Q4** translates to ~**EUR 400 million revenue reduction**. It's not visible in the order book, nor are there clear messages from customers. It's a derisking measure, and could have been 5%.
* Q from Didier Scemama - Bank of America: Maybe my final question on AI. I just wanted to know if you -- because you haven't really talked about your guide for this year or for next year. So are we still on track for EUR 600 million for this year? And is the EUR 1 billion sort of achievable next year in spite of FX? So should we assume a haircut also because of FX? A: Infineon absolutely confirms the **EUR 600 million** AI revenue prediction for the current year and reconfirms the **EUR 1 billion** target for next year. Infineon powers AI from the grid to the core, optimizing power efficiency and density in data centers.
* Q from Menon Janardan - Jefferies: I just want to go back to the fiscal Q4 outlook. Let's assume that you don't get any kind of a tariff impact, which may be unrealistic. But just looking at where your order book is currently, how would you expect the different businesses to perform into Q4? Would the -- I'm not asking for specific quarter-on-quarter guidance by business. But would the maximum strongest momentum be in the automotive division into Q4 based on your current visibility or would it be a continuing rebound in industrial, both GIP and the PSS as well as in AI? I mean, just qualitatively, can you tell me based on your current visibility, what Q4 is looking like? A: For an unaffected quarter with normal seasonality, stronger growth momentum would typically be seen in **automotive** and **PSS**. Industrial inventory digestion is abating but still ongoing.
* Q from Menon Janardan - Jefferies: And on the GIP price pressure, it appears to me that this is not going to go away because Chinese competitors are predominantly competing with you in the power discrete side, especially IGBTs and going forward, possibly silicon carbide. And some of your non-Chinese competitors are also likely to be trying to get some share there. How do you see -- how do you -- and we are dealing with that in the longer term, not so much what's the FY '25 outlook, but '26, '27. This is something you'll have to deal with on an ongoing basis. Is there any action or strategic approach that you can take to sort of mitigate this effect on overall Infineon's numbers going forward? A: The market needs to be segmented. For **high-reliability modules** (e.g., ESS, transmission), Infineon can differentiate through packaging. On the front-end technology side, Infineon is **1-2 generations ahead** in SiC MOSFETs and silicon MOSFETs in terms of area efficiency and figure of merits. Standard power components like residential solar inverter discretes are less of a focus. **Automotive** is a strong segment, with **double-digit revenue growth** in China year-over-year, and power infrastructure also offers differentiation due to demanding applications.
* Q from Stephane Houri - ODDO BHF: Yes, actually, I have a question on the -- your comments about the end of the inventory collection notably in the automotive space. Can you maybe remind us what is the current level of inventories in terms of number of weeks at your automotive customers? And do you see the automotive market, let's say, stabilizing everywhere in terms of geography, but also in terms of mix, EV versus hybrid, IC, et cetera? Can you maybe give us some overview about what's happening there? A: Overall inventory in the distribution channel is on target, at the upper end of **10-12 weeks**, with automotive in line. Transparency at Tier 1s is limited, but the average is normal. Some Tier 1s are managing inventory down due to cash constraints. The automotive business picked up in the last quarter, especially currency neutral.
* Q from Stephane Houri - ODDO BHF: And regarding China, is there anything specific happening in the Chinese market, which has been driving the growth while the others were a bit, let's say, negative so far? A: The China automotive market is strong, and Infineon's automotive revenue grew **double-digit year-over-year** in China. Infineon has increased its auto market share in China to **13.9%** due to portfolio breadth, P2S approach, and reliability commitment.
* Q from Joshua Buchalter - TD Cowen: For my first one, I wanted to ask about the auto MCU business. I mean you showed another year of very meaningful share growth. I think you hit 32%. I mean how much further can that go? Are you reaching the point where the market is getting pretty saturated and more concentrated than usual? And -- or do you think there's more room to run on the auto MCU share gain side, given your investments in SDV in your AURIX family? A: Design wins date back 3-5 years, and further gains are expected. Infineon is in the transition from **65nm to 40nm generation**, with a significant design win step function in the 40nm generation, indicating a good runway for continued share growth.
* Q from Joshua Buchalter - TD Cowen: Okay. And I apologize, it's early here, but I'm a little confused on the gross margin half-over-half direction. I mean it looks like revenue is going to be up sort of high single digits. You mentioned how you basically maintained the guidance despite the 10% haircut. So I can imagine there's a huge change in volumes there. Can you help -- is there a currency impact on the COGS line? I know you gave the rule of thumb on revenue and operating income. But yes, I just remain a little bit confused as to why gross margin is going to be down sort of 100, 150 basis points half over half. A: The full-year gross margin remains "around **40%**." The second half might look "a little bit more from the south" to 40% if the tariff haircut materializes. Currency impact is factored into the profitability rule of thumb ($0.10 for profitability, $0.25 per quarter on revenue).
* Q from Sandeep Deshpande - JPMorgan: I have a question actually following up to Janardan's earlier question on pricing, but actually related to automotive. I mean one of your big U.S. competitors has talked about using pricing as a lever to keep their share or grow their share. I mean, are we going back to the bad old days in semiconductors and particularly in automotive semiconductors where they seem to be wanting to keep their share in terms of pricing? And how does that -- how is Infineon seeing this game being played out? A: Most automotive business is under **annual price agreements**, which came in as predicted. In the specific area of **silicon carbide**, prices are coming down, largely due to **forward pricing** as substrates become a commodity and the **8-inch transition** rolls out. Infineon has other means, including increased volume from **Kulim** and leading-edge **SiC trench technology**, so it's not seen as a general automotive pricing change.
* Q from Sandeep Deshpande - JPMorgan: Understood. And a follow-up on your business with the hyperscalers, et cetera. There you clearly gained more share than you expected in the first half of the year because of how the share between yourselves and some of your other competitors played out in the platform. So what we are hearing through the supply chain that share between yourselves and the competitors is going to change somewhat into the second half of the year. Is that going to play out in your revenues? And is that going to impact your revenues into the second half of the year at all? A: All developments are within previous statements. Infineon is growing revenue towards **EUR 600 million** this year (from EUR 250 million last year) and **EUR 1 billion** next year, indicating continued share gains in a growing market.
* Q from Jakob Bluestone - BNP Paribas: I just had a question on the CapEx guidance. You cut your CapEx by EUR 200 million. Is that just currency? Or are there areas where you're scaling back in anticipation of the potential tariff effects? A: There is a minor currency effect, but the bigger reason is the **push out of major front-end buildings** (Dresden, Kulim) into the next fiscal quarter. Of the **EUR 2.3 billion** CapEx, approximately EUR 1 billion is for maintenance and capitalization, half for front-end buildings, and half for capacity growth, primarily in AI and wide bandgap. Dresden Module 4 is still considered necessary for mid- to long-term growth.
* Q from Andrew Gardiner - Citi: I had one on the -- just on the outlook and how you're perhaps managing between what you're telling us in terms of the financial communication and the actual operations. I fully appreciate you trying to derisk numbers for this year. I think we all appreciate that relative to the approach some of your global peers have taken. But when you got orders actually increasing and customers aren't actually changing anything yet, are you -- you're factoring in an underutilization charge in the guidance that you're giving us. But are you actually slowing the fabs already? Is there -- how are you managing that risk? You can tell us that you're taking a guess in terms of the communication to the market. But it's obviously much more difficult, more risky for you to just take a guess as to how to actually manage the fab loading and your production. A: Infineon is preparing measures to potentially **reduce fab loading further for the summer** and will observe order entry for the next 2-3 months. High inventory levels also help balance short-term movements, acknowledging it's a challenging situation.
* Q from Adithya Metuku - HSBC: So firstly, just thinking through the -- thinking about the underlying guide. You clearly upgrading your guide, excluding the impact from tariffs and FX. So I just wondered if you could give us some color on which end markets are driving this underlying upgrade? Where are you seeing better trends than you expected maybe a quarter or 2 ago? A: It's not an upgrade, but a **confirmation of the previous guidance** without the tariff haircuts. It reflects the modest recovery in key end markets in the second half, following inventory digestion.
* Q from Adithya Metuku - HSBC: And then just as a follow-on to the previous question. If your tariff assumptions turn out to be conservative, say, midway through the quarter, how quickly can you ramp up production to meet end demand? Any color around that would be great. A: If the tariff effect doesn't materialize, fab loading would gradually increase. Infineon has various means to manage loading flexibility, including overtime budgets and the German short-time work scheme.
* Q from Adithya Metuku - HSBC: Understood. Maybe just a quick follow-up on silicon carbide. Post the BYD announcement around the megawatt charging, I just wondered if you are seeing any additional interest in SiC design wins picking up from customers for fast charging. A: While BYD's announcement is interesting, the value proposition of silicon carbide remains fully intact for battery electric vehicles, and its adoption is rapidly increasing across the globe. Infineon also offers 1,500V and 1,700V SiC MOSFETs.
* Q from Lee Simpson - Morgan Stanley: So let's keep it to 1 question then. Maybe I'll just ask on product development. We've had a lot of questions already on the tariffing. I thought it was quite interesting. You mentioned a couple of developments there. I think the PSOC, especially the work in CAPSENSE, looks quite interesting. Could you maybe just surmise for us what the end markets would be. It does look as so physical AI might be something you're considering. And then maybe just associated with product development. Are we assuming that -- you've done superjunction for quite some time, but trench in superjunction here for silicon carbide that looks like a first for the market. And did you say 800 volts? And is that really being targeted at China? A: Infineon is introducing its first **SiC trench in superjunction** combination, which is believed to propel them ahead in cell generations. **PSOC CAPSENSE** is an interesting IP for capacitive sensing (e.g., home appliances) and now also **inductive sensing** (e.g., for wet hands, liquid level sensing) for industrial applications. R&D investments continue in profitable growth areas, while SG&A sees impact from competitiveness initiatives.
* Q from S√©bastien Sztabowicz - Kepler Cheuvreux: One on the fab loading. Where are you standing right now in both your front-end and back-end fab? And how do you see your fab loading moving into the second part of the year given your assumption for top line and the 10% haircut? A: Current fab loading is in the **70s** for front-end and **high 60s** for back-end. If the tariff guesstimate doesn't materialize, loading will gradually increase. If it does, adjustments will be made, which are incorporated into the guidance. Underutilization charges are now split ~**55% H1, 45% H2** (previously 60-40) due to haircut-related additional idle in Q4.

‚ùì KEY ANALYST Q&A:
* Q: Is the 7% sequential guidance driven by pull-ins ahead of tariffs, and what is the overall impact of tariffs on demand signals?
* A: Management observes a genuine cycle recovery in industrial, personal electronics, enterprise, and communications markets, with customers holding very low inventory. While not directly attributing orders to tariffs, there's an expectation that customer anxiety might lead to increased inventory building. The Q2 forecast is considered a typical seasonal forecast, potentially slightly above due to this anxiety.
* Q: What is **Texas Instruments'** exposure to China tariffs, and how does the company plan to offset potential impacts, including through consignment inventory?
* A: China-headquartered customers represent 19-20% of revenue. **Texas Instruments** provides **geopolitically dependable capacity**, leveraging existing inventory (some consigned) and close customer relationships. The company possesses significant flexibility, including internal dual-flow capabilities and external partners, to support customers in navigating changing trade rules and ensuring supply continuity.
* Q: What is the outlook for factory loadings and gross margin given current inventory levels and demand trends?
* A: Gross margin outperformed expectations due to higher revenue, a favorable industrial product mix, and factory loadings that, while down sequentially, were higher than initially anticipated. For Q2, **Texas Instruments** expects factory loadings to increase slightly, and gross margin is projected to improve compared to Q1.
* Q: How is **Texas Instruments** managing supply chain dynamics amidst geopolitical changes, and what role does its global manufacturing footprint play in this strategy?
* A: **Texas Instruments** is actively collaborating with customers to adapt to evolving supply chain rules, emphasizing its flexible and **geopolitically dependable capacity**. This includes leveraging internal dual-flow capabilities (e.g., disaster recovery frameworks), utilizing external partners, and strategically shifting supply between its global fabs (e.g., from Taiwan foundries to the Lehi fab, or utilizing underutilized 200mm fabs). The focus is on optimizing logistics and cycle times for qualified parts to ensure efficient supply.

üîç DETAILED ANALYST Q&A:
* Q from Timothy Arcuri - UBS: Is the 7% sequential guidance due to pull-ins ahead of tariffs, and what's the impact of tariffs on demand signals?
* A: Haviv Ilan states that Q1's recovery is a real cycle recovery, not tariff-related, with industrial joining personal electronics, enterprise, and communications markets. Customers are experiencing very low inventory levels, sometimes only a few days, and 'orders within the quarter turns' are strengthening. For Q2, the environment is dynamic. While customers don't explicitly state tariff-driven orders, anxiety likely leads to a desire for more inventory. The Q2 forecast is a 'seasonal, maybe a little bit typical seasonal' forecast. Mike Beckman adds that Q2 revenue linearity is as expected given low inventory and diverse end markets.
* Q from Timothy Arcuri - UBS: What is **Texas Instruments'** exposure to China tariffs, and how can it be offset, including through consignment?
* A: Haviv Ilan emphasizes providing 'geopolitically dependable capacity'. China-headquartered customers represented 19% of revenue last year and 20% in Q1. **Texas Instruments** maintains long-term relationships, offering product breadth, quality, scale, and service, including inventory on hand (some consigned, some near manufacturing plants). Chinese customers aim to maintain a global presence. **Texas Instruments** has flexibility and works case-by-case to support immediate needs and alleviate concerns for the second half of 2025 and 2026.
* Q from Vivek Arya - Bank of America Securities: What is the outlook for factory loadings and gross margin given current inventory levels?
* A: Rafael Lizardi explains that gross margin outperformed expectations due to higher revenue, a greater industrial mix, and higher-than-expected factory loadings (though down versus Q4). For Q2, the base case expects factory loadings to increase slightly, and gross margin is projected to be up versus Q1.
* Q from Vivek Arya - Bank of America Securities: What is driving Q2 to be at the upper end of seasonality despite macro and tariff headwinds, specifically by segment (industrial, automotive, consumer) or product (Analog, Embedded)?
* A: Haviv Ilan states that in a normal up cycle, some quarters need to run above seasonality to return to the trend line. Demand signals show continued strengthening. Industrial signals have been strong for about 5 months, with above-seasonality performance in Q4 and Q1 (close to 10% growth). Automotive, a latecomer to the recovery, grew sequentially and year-over-year in Q1, with a very shallow cycle (mid- to high single-digit on a trailing 12-month basis). Q2 is expected to behave very similarly to Q1.
* Q from Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research: You initially stated no pull-forward, but then mentioned customers wanting to hold more inventory, which seems contradictory. Does **Texas Instruments** care about pull-forward, or do you simply ship if you can fulfill the order?
* A: Haviv Ilan clarifies that Q1's dominant signal was a broad, consistent return of demand, an acceleration of the aging trend from Q4, not anxiety-driven. For Q2, current signals are a continuation of the cycle, but he speculates industrial customers might want more inventory due to anxiety, calling it 'modern industrial plus a little bit,' a typical cycle behavior. **Texas Instruments** has a playbook for up cycles and will manage customers' demand in a structured way, not just 'flagging them with stuff they don't need.'
* Q from Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research: Have order rates materially accelerated in the two weeks post-tariff announcement compared to exiting Q1?
* A: Haviv Ilan states their forecast represents what they are seeing now. Mike Beckman adds it's difficult to rule out specific reasons for orders, but linearity since the quarter began is about what's expected for a Q1-Q2 transition and recovering end markets, so 'not unusual.'
* Q from Tore Svanberg - Stifel: Is there any regional display in the recent activity, given variances in potential tariffs by region?
* A: Haviv Ilan explains **Texas Instruments** is working closely with customers who are re-evaluating supply chains due to changing rules, offering 'geopolitically dependable capacity'. For China-headquartered customers, **Texas Instruments** has internal dual-flow capability (e.g., disaster recovery framework from Japan earthquake) for most of its portfolio, requiring immediate logistics adaptation. They also use external partners (e.g., Embedded business shifting manufacturing from Taiwan foundries to the Lehi fab). **Texas Instruments** has 4 fabs outside the U.S. (3 in Japan, 1 in China, 1 in Germany) and most U.S. parts also run there. These fabs, though less cost-efficient than 300mm, are competitive and allow supply shifts. It's a complex execution plan, but teams are engaged to navigate evolving supply chain dynamics into H2 2025 and next year.
* Q from Thomas O'Malley - Barclays: Can **Texas Instruments'** China facility meet all demand coming from China specifically, or how much of that demand can be met with the in-country footprint?
* A: Haviv Ilan states customers seek a 'dependable capacity footprint,' not just domestic manufacturing. **Texas Instruments'** manufacturing footprint (U.S., Asia, Europe) and external partners position them well. The challenge is quick logistics and optimizing cost for supply. If a qualified part needs to be shipped from Japan instead of Dallas, it's manageable. **Texas Instruments** has a fab and a large AT facility in China, providing a good footprint for China and worldwide customers.
* Q from Thomas O'Malley - Barclays: When a chip is produced in a certain geography, is the back-end manufacturing always associated with that same foundry, or is it shipped to different places?
* A: Haviv Ilan states 'no' to back-end always being associated with the same foundry. Rafael Lizardi confirms 'almost unlimited amount of permutations' for fabs, ATs, and processes. A wafer can be fabbed in the U.S., assembled in Malaysia, and tested in Taiwan. Haviv adds that some changes can be made immediately, others take longer. Routing parts (logistics/IT) is easiest. AT (assembly and test) is also relatively simple due to lower cycle times. The base chip layer has the longest cycle time, requiring customer information to solve problems quickly.
* Q from William Stein - Truist Securities: Can you break down growth between pricing and volume, specifically as it relates to tariffs? Was there any quantifiable price benefit from new tariffs in Q1 results or Q2 guidance?
* A: Haviv Ilan states growth is 'based on just stripping more volume to customers,' reflecting the recovery of the cycle, with no quantifiable price benefit from tariffs.
* Q from William Stein - Truist Securities: Can you provide an update on the competition in China, especially given observations of intensifying competition and some competitors changing their approach?
* A: Haviv Ilan confirms intensifying competition in China across general purpose and application-specific parts, citing a Chinese competitor in 77 GHz chips. He calls China a 'conditioning room' for competitiveness. **Texas Instruments** competes on product breadth, quality, scale, and service. Supply and capacity (having inventory with short lead times) are crucial for Chinese customers, who are often early indicators in cycles. **Texas Instruments'** competitive advantages include portfolio breadth (solving many problems with one company) and diverse, **geopolitically dependable manufacturing**.
* Q from Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley: With regards to Chinese tariffs, customers seem to lack clarity on the exact tariff rate, yet tariffs appear to be charged immediately. What are the mechanics of this rapid implementation?
* A: Mike Beckman reiterates the dynamic environment and **Texas Instruments'** flexibility to navigate it. The question of 'who pays' is about competitiveness. **Texas Instruments'** competitive advantages (flexibility, **geopolitically dependable footprint**) allow them to be competitive and support customers. Haviv Ilan adds that many things can change, and **Texas Instruments** gauges demand through customer orders and backlog. Their objective is to serve customers well with high quality, delivering positive results now and into the future.

‚ùì KEY ANALYST Q&A:
* Q: What is the impact of tariffs and macro uncertainty on the Q2 guidance, and what is the company's assessment of potential impact? A: Management has no indications of major movements (pull-ins or push-outs) from large customers due to trade climate changes. The company is continuously working on developing an even more diversified and resilient supply chain as a fabless operator, and supporting customers with new products and potential challenges from trade changes.
* Q: Are market inventory adjustments behind us, particularly in the industrial segment? A: Market inventories are largely normalized, showing good flow-through from Nordic via distribution to end customers. A recovery is observed in industrial markets, especially in Europe, where excess inventories are improving, leading to increased demand.
* Q: How is the company positioned in the Chinese market amidst trade disputes, and are there opportunities from geopolitical shifts? A: The Chinese market continues to grow strongly for Nordic Semiconductor in both business and new design activity. The company is actively addressing opportunities arising from trade tensions, seeing additional traction and opportunities, particularly in North America and Europe, especially for more complex cellular and long-range products, as Western customers may seek alternatives to Chinese vendors.

üîç DETAILED ANALYST Q&A:
* Q from Harry Blaiklock - UBS: I know you mentioned risks around tariffs and macro uncertainty. It sounds like at this stage, you haven't factored anything into your Q2 guide at all. I just wanted to confirm that that's the case. And then, I know it's obviously a bit of an impossible question. But do you have any current assessment of what the impact kind of should be even if it's just a bit of a range, that would be helpful. A: Management confirms no indications of major movements, neither pull-ins nor push-outs or changes due to trade climate changes, from large customers. The current order view and updated forecast engine are stable. While scenarios have been assessed, they are not being shared. The company feels it's on a relatively even playing field with peers and is continuously working on an even more diversified and resilient supply chain as a fabless operator, while innovating and supporting customers with new products relative to potential trade changes.
* Q from Harry Blaiklock - UBS: Maybe a quick follow-up is hopefully a bit of a simpler question. I'm wondering whether you can comment on orders and how they developed during the quarter, whether they kind of stepped up sequentially in Q1 versus Q4 and then how they've been tracking at the start of Q1. Also, if you could -- if you are able to share your current book-to-bill, that would be helpful as well. A: In Q1, the company saw some additional and boosted orders and deliverables to certain individual large customers. However, no bigger movements or changes have been observed in the forecast engine throughout the last half year; it remains fairly consistent. The company does not comment on book-to-bill.
* Q from Unknown Analyst - Jefferies: I had a question on your order patterns from the large customers in the first quarter. So you did see elevated Tier 1 order patterns. And I wanted to sort of get a sense of was this broad in terms of the end markets across Industrial, Consumer and Healthcare? Or was it skewed to a specific end market in the quarter? And then how should we think about these elevated orders into the second quarter in terms of your $145 million to $165 million revenue guide? A: The elevated orders in Q1 were present in both Consumer and Industrial and Healthcare segments. Management is not repeating this comment for the Q2 guidance, indicating that a similar effect is not anticipated for Q2.
* Q from Christoffer Bj√∏rnsen - DNB Markets: On that note, I just wanted to ask, you highlight that there was several customers, but one in particular that did do some higher volumes in Q1. So could you maybe help us understand kind of the magnitude of that just for us to kind of gauge the underlying sequential momentum that you're expecting from Q1 into Q2 in broad strokes? A: Management clarifies that it was several large customers, not a single one, across both reporting segments. The company does not quantify the magnitude of these orders, but it was important to signal them when entering Q1.
* Q from Christoffer Bj√∏rnsen - DNB Markets: And then just a quick follow-up. Long-range was up pretty much year-over-year in Q1. It's been lumpy. Can you try to help us understand if this new level is kind of reflecting a more stable level with bigger, more kind of stable customers? Or is this likely to be -- could be up and down massively in Q2 as well? A: The company is continuing positive progress in its long-range business, which is important. However, it is still a smaller contribution to total revenue, and some fluctuations are expected going forward. There is strong design interest for the new nRF9151 module and satellite communication, but these are relatively long design cycles for complex products requiring infrastructure design elements. Management is very positive about current design activity and interest.
* Q from S√©bastien Sztabowicz - Kepler Cheuvreux: I'm just wondering where we are standing with respect to the inventories in your main market. Is it fair to assume that now the inventory adjustments are clearly behind us? A: Market inventories are pretty normalized, with good flow-through from Nordic via distribution to end customers. While there might have been some excess inventories in areas like industrial in Europe, a recovery is now being observed, which should lead to increased demand.
* Q from S√©bastien Sztabowicz - Kepler Cheuvreux: And the second question is linked to the Chinese market and the world market. Have you made any specific, I would say, progress with respect to this market? And do you see any specific implication from the trade dispute with your opportunity in the Chinese market? A: China has been growing continuously for Nordic Semiconductor after the pandemic shortage, both in business and new design activity, and continues to be strong. No disruptive major changes have been observed regarding competitors in the Chinese market in the last three months. Nordic is recognized as a high-quality, high-performance provider in China, particularly for products requiring interoperability and high-quality radio performance for international markets.
* Q from George Brown - Deutsche Bank: I have 2, if I may. So just firstly, I guess, at a high level, just following on that China topic. Are you guys like somewhat favorably positioned in this geopolitical environment? I see one of your Chinese competitors, I think, cellular, I believe, got recently blacklisted. So I guess my question is, are you seeing more design activity or conversations with Western customers that previously relied maybe on cheaper Chinese vendors, but are now concerned about security or whatever. And so this opens up opportunities for you guys to take some share. Any comments on that would be helpful. A: The company is aggressively and actively addressing opportunities arising from trade tension and regulatory changes. This is potentially giving additional traction and opportunity, particularly in North America and Europe, especially for more complex products in the cellular and long-range segments.
* Q from George Brown - Deutsche Bank: And then secondly, just on Matter and Fred, I think your main peer in the U.S. was recently talking about more design activity in Matter in the smart home. Can you remind us of where we sit in terms of Matter adoption? And are you sort of seeing any revival of interest there? A: The company is seeing increasing design activity for Matter. While acknowledging that adoption has taken longer than some hoped, strong activity is observed, and there are strong positive beliefs for its future.
* Q from √òystein Lodgaard - ABG: If you look at the segment performance, there is a very strong sequential performance in the Industrial and Healthcare segment. And just I wonder if you could shed some light on what you think are the key drivers behind that? Is this due to inventory levels of customers? Is it ramping up of new designs? Or are there -- could there be some pull-in effects here? Could you just help us explain this, please? A: Management does not provide more granularity on segment revenues to avoid identifying individual customer details. However, improvements are seen across the Industrial and Healthcare segment, including in Europe industrial, which was previously very slow and latest in the downturn.
* Q from √òystein Lodgaard - ABG: Okay. Then as a follow-up, let me try to rephrase. One of your peers reported last week and said they saw low inventory levels, particularly in the Industrial segment, and that segment is now doing a comeback. Is that the same thing that you are seeing in the market, your customers? A: The company confirms seeing a recovery in the industrial area, not to super growth, but an improvement as large inventories from the last year normalize. Customers typically maintain inventories based on days of inventory, so a lower run rate implies coming from a lower inventory level.

This expanded OEE deployment provides a robust baseline on unutilized capacity, enabling more agile adjustments to sourcing strategies in response to changing trade landscapes. Safety performance continues to improve, with the incident rate down **25%** in the quarter.
* **Capital allocation:** **3M** maintains a balanced capital deployment strategy. In Q1, the company refinanced **$1.1 billion** in debt and returned **$1.7 billion** to shareholders, including a **4%** dividend increase. The Board approved a **$7.5 billion** share repurchase authorization, with expected repurchases for 2025 increasing to **$2 billion** from a prior expectation of **$1.5 billion**. The company is also advancing its portfolio shaping efforts, having signed one small divestiture, though others are progressing slower due to trade policy uncertainty.

üìà SEGMENT PERFORMANCE:
* **Safety and Industrial** revenue was **$2,745.00 million**, a **0.48%** increase year-over-year, driven by strong demand for **cable accessories** (data centers, renewable energy), **industrial and electronics bonding solutions** (structural adhesives, improved service), and **personal safety** (government contracts).
* **Transportation and Electronics** revenue was **$1,990.00 million**, a **-5.42%** decrease year-over-year, with organic sales up **1.1%** driven by **double-digit growth in aerospace** (commercial aircraft, defense) and **high single-digit growth in advanced materials**. This was partially offset by softer **electronics business** performance due to lower device demand and a **mid-single-digit decline in auto OEM** reflecting continued weakness in auto builds in Europe and the U.S.
* **Consumer** revenue was **$1,124.00 million**, a **-1.40%** decrease year-over-year, with organic sales up **0.3%** driven by strength in **Filtrete filters**, **respiratory products**, **paint protection**, and **Meguiar's Auto Care**, partially offset by soft consumer spending in **Command** and **Packaging expression**.

‚ùì KEY ANALYST Q&A:
* Q: What are 3M's strategies to mitigate the impact of tariffs, and what is the expected financial offset? A: 3M is implementing a three-pronged approach: sourcing and logistics actions (e.g., changing source of supply, optimizing value-add locations, exploring alternative production sites), discretionary cost actions, and surgical price adjustments. These actions are expected to offset $0.20 to $0.40 per share, with the high end being a 50-50 split between cost/sourcing and pricing. Some actions are immediate, while others may take longer or require investment, potentially benefiting 2026.
* Q: What is the current macroeconomic outlook and demand trend across 3M's key segments? A: Q1 order rates were up 2%, with backlog up low teens. The industrial business (SIBG) shows continued momentum into April, similar to March. The electronics business (TEBG) is slightly softer, and consumer typically starts slow. Overall, 3M expects stable organic growth around 1.5%-2% for the year, with Q2 at or slightly better than Q1, and a slight pickup in the second half. Global auto builds are down 1.8%, with U.S. down 9%, and consumer electronics are expected to be up low single digits.
* Q: How is 3M leveraging operational efficiency initiatives, and are these being accelerated due to current market conditions? A: The challenging environment is driving deeper analysis into operations, revealing opportunities for enhanced efficiency. 3M is intensifying its focus on existing operational excellence initiatives, including improving on-time in-full delivery, operational equipment effectiveness (OEE), productivity, and cost per quality. These efforts are contributing to margin improvement and G&A tightening, indicating a strategic acceleration of efficiency actions.
* Q: What is 3M's strategy for its China market given the tariff impacts, and is there a consideration to reduce sales? A: 3M maintains a strong business in China, which represents 10% of company revenue and grew double digits last year. Management stated that walking away from sales is not an option. Instead, they are exploring network shifts, such as shipping products from Europe to China instead of the U.S., to mitigate tariff impacts while preserving customer relationships. No anti-American sentiment has been observed from customers.

üîç DETAILED ANALYST Q&A:
* Q from Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Could you provide color on macro trends, the March exit rate, how things progressed into April, and whether March activity indicated pre-buy actions by customers? A: Management observed minimal pre-buy activity, with only about $10 million moving from Q2 to Q1, primarily in China. Q1 order rates were up a little over 2%, and backlog ended March up low teens. In April, the industrial business (SIBG) showed continued momentum, with order rates similar to March. The electronics business (TEBG) was a bit softer, and consumer typically starts slow in the quarter.
* Q from Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners: Regarding tariffs, what are the levers for mitigation, specifically on pricing and the market's ability to absorb price increases, and what are the 'no regret' moves? A: Mitigation involves three buckets: 1) Sourcing and logistics actions, including changing source of supply, adjusting trade flows, leveraging bond facilities/free trade zones, optimizing value-add locations, and exploring alternative production sites. Some actions are quick, others require time or investment (potentially benefiting 2026). 2) Discretionary cost actions, while protecting growth investments. 3) Selected surgical price actions, such as surcharges or list price changes, which will be more limited. The $0.20-$0.40 EPS offset is expected to be about 50-50 between cost/sourcing and pricing at the high end. 3M also sees offensive opportunities due to its large U.S. footprint.
* Q from Scott Davis - Melius Research: Do you feel 3M is more or less exposed than the average competitor to tariff risk, and how does this inform the ability to get price? A: 3M's exposure is mixed across its diverse businesses. While 3M exports $4 billion, including to China, its network flexibility allows for advantageous cost and sourcing actions. Management believes 3M is 'probably a little bit better positioned than a lot of our competitors.' Pricing ability will vary by business, depending on competitive nature and product differentiation, and is being pursued in close collaboration with partners.
* Q from Scott Davis - Melius Research: Have you observed any anti-American purchasing behaviors from customers, or is that not a real concern yet? A: Management has not seen any anti-American purchasing behaviors yet and is not necessarily anticipating them. 3M has very strong global brands and a significant U.S. presence with 50 factories and substantial R&D, but has not experienced any risk due to being a U.S.-based manufacturer or having U.S.-based brands.
* Q from Julian Mitchell - Barclays: Could you elaborate on the organic sales outlook, specifically whether it's steady growth around 1.5%-2% or if a dip is expected this quarter before improvement in the back half, with segment color? A: 3M is trending towards the lower end of its organic sales range, but expects stability throughout the year. The operating cadence is split equally between the first and second halves, implying Q2 sales will be at or slightly better than Q1, with a slight pickup in H2. Industrial (SIBG) shows good growth momentum. Electronics (TEBG) has pockets of weakness due to macro and auto factors, potentially being lower than initially thought. Consumer is expected to pick up after a flat Q1. No dip is expected in Q2 due to backlog coverage and industrial orders.
* Q from Julian Mitchell - Barclays: Regarding the $0.60 gross headwind and $0.30 net headwind from tariffs, how should we think about the phasing of the $0.30 net headwind through the year, and is there any color on the impact by segment? A: The main tariff impact, particularly from U.S.-China tariffs, started in April. Due to 3M's typical 90 days of inventory, the significant impact will be seen mainly in the second half of the year, with only a small impact (a couple of pennies) in Q2, which is within guidance. Management is working quickly on mitigation actions, with cost controls being faster, pricing coming in, and offensive strategy benefits materializing towards the end of the year or next year. The impact will be mitigated more as the year progresses.
* Q from Amit Mehrotra - UBS: Could you help us understand the EPS cadence from Q1 into Q2 and the rest of the year, considering various moving parts like stock compensation, costs, and tariffs? A: For Q2 year-over-year, EPS growth is expected to be $0.15-$0.20 operationally (from volume, restructuring, productivity, lower equity comp), partially offset by Q1 timing events, increased investments, and PFAS stranded costs. A non-operational headwind of about $0.10 is expected, mainly from net interest due to lower cash balances. Net year-over-year EPS growth is projected at $0.05-$0.10. Sequentially from Q1 to Q2, revenue should be up about $300 million with good flow-through, leading to an operational benefit of $0.05-$0.10, plus a $0.05 benefit below the line, totaling $0.10-$0.15 sequential EPS benefit. First-half EPS growth is projected at $0.22-$0.27, representing about 50% of the full-year expectation.
* Q from Amit Mehrotra - UBS: Does the current challenging environment provide an opportunity to accelerate some of the efficiency actions 3M is pursuing? A: Yes, the challenging situation is prompting a deeper, SKU-by-SKU analysis of the business, which is highlighting opportunities for different and better ways of operating. While 3M has been focused on operational excellence, the current environment puts more focus and attention on initiatives like improving on-time in-full, operational equipment effectiveness (OEE), productivity, and cost per quality. This deeper understanding of trade flows also points to opportunities for tightening G&A, indicating an acceleration of efficiency efforts.
* Q from C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: What is 3M's current assumption for ForEx year-over-year, given it was previously negative $0.20? A: 3M is now expecting a $0.15 headwind from ForEx, down from the previous $0.20. The Euro rate was snapped around $1.08-$1.09 at the end of March. While the U.S. dollar's continued strength could further reduce this headwind, not all FX rates move in the same direction, and 3M has net cost positions in some cases. The focus remains on operational performance, and any further FX upside will be shared as it materializes.
* Q from C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan: Regarding China, are there sales that 3M could simply 'walk from,' especially exports from the U.S. to China, and how critical are these to customers? A: Walking away from sales is not an option. 3M has a very strong business in China, which includes important domestic and export customers. Instead, 3M is exploring opportunities to shift its network, such as shipping products from Europe to China instead of the U.S., and then backfilling that volume in the U.S. This strategy aims to mitigate tariff impacts while preserving customer relationships and the significant business in China, which accounts for 10% of the company's revenue.
* Q from Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research: Are there any adverse impacts from the China tariffs on the supply chain, such as shippers pausing shipments due to news flow? A: Management has not seen any such impacts yet. There has been no disruption, no supplier hesitation to ship, and no significant push on pricing observed so far, despite reading about such possibilities.
* Q from Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research: Does the imposition of tariffs, which require payment on day one, put more of a back-end load on cash flow? A: No, management does not expect a material change to cash flow. Q1 cash flow was strong despite being a typically low quarter, with net income of about $1 billion and $300 million of working capital consumption. This was aided by disciplined CapEx spending and receivables management. 3M is focusing on DSO (Days Sales Outstanding) and AP (Accounts Payable) payments and does not anticipate increased pressure in the second half of the year, expecting good cash flow growth throughout the year.
* Q from Andrew Obin - Bank of America: Is 3M modeling any demand destruction related to tariffs in its core guide, given that price increases could lead to some demand destruction? A: The tariff impact modeled is primarily a cost impact sensitivity. While the market has been weaker, leading to 3M trending towards the lower end of its guidance range, no additional demand destruction from pricing has been modeled. 3M's pricing strategy is described as 'smart, strategic, and surgical,' often involving consultation with customers or distributors. Surcharges are generally understood, and volume is not expected to deteriorate. If significant volume impact from pricing becomes a concern later in the year, it will be reconsidered.
* Q from Andrew Obin - Bank of America: Why is 3M not being more aggressive on stock buybacks, given the stock weakness and operational momentum? A: The recent buyback activity was primarily a timing issue related to options exercise, specifically 2015 options that came in-the-money in February. 3M has a $7.5 billion authorization, which increased from $1.5 billion to $2 billion, and retains the optionality to be more aggressive in the second half of the year depending on the business situation.
* Q from Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank: Have G&A productivity expectations shifted for the full year, and are there any major highlights on the timing of growth investments? A: Growth investments are on track, with a planned increase of $225 million for the year, including $50 million in Q1 and a significant step-up in Q2. R&D as a percentage of revenue increased by 60 basis points in Q1. On G&A, Q1 performance included $0.07 of structural and permanent G&A efficiency, primarily from centralizing external services and leveraging global buying power. Management expects these benefits to increase throughout the year, with at least $50 million of G&A improvement from Q1 expected to flow through.
* Q from Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank: What are 3M's expectations for auto builds and electronics for 2025? A: Global auto builds are now projected down 1.8% (with U.S. down 9% and Europe down 4-5%), reflecting a recent removal of about 1.5 million units from the full-year forecast. 3M expects its auto OE business to be down mid-single digits for both the quarter and the year. Consumer electronics are anticipated to be up low single digits, representing flat to modest growth for the year, despite some channel stockpiling in Q1.
* Q from Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi: Why did TEBG (Transportation & Electronics Business Group) margin remain under pressure in Q1, similar to Q4, despite expectations for margin growth across all segments? A: While all three business groups are expected to expand margins in 2025, TEBG's Q1 performance was lower due to PFAS stranded costs, higher investments, and an unfavorable mix. Q1 last year had strong, higher-margin Electronics sales, which shifted the mix this quarter. Management expects TEBG margins to expand through the rest of the year.
* Q from Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi: 3M's industrial businesses are holding up well in terms of order growth, despite some recent weaker regional manufacturing surveys. What are your thoughts on this divergence? A: It's still very early in the quarter, but conversations with customers and distributors indicate reasonably solid trends continuing into April, consistent with March. While 3M is monitoring softening regional indicators, channel inventory is generally normalized, and no correction is observed. The elongation of orders (45-50 day cycle stretching longer) continues. Overall, macro indicators for the industrial business still look okay, but 3M is watching carefully.
* Q from Joseph O'Dea - Wells Fargo: How is 3M tactically approaching imports from China, and are you pausing orders given the fluid nature of tariff headlines? A: 3M is not pausing any orders or shipments from China. Due to 90 days of inventory, the tariff impact on imports will primarily be seen after the end of June. The tactical approach involves sourcing, logistics, discretionary cost actions, and pricing adjustments (surcharges or new list prices), ensuring business continues as usual.
* Q from Joseph O'Dea - Wells Fargo: To confirm, is there a higher weighting of exposure on those imports from China to the consumer side of the business? A: Yes, the element of tariff impact articulated by management would be more concentrated on the Consumer business.
* Q from Joseph O'Dea - Wells Fargo: Are there any updates or changes to the initial expectations for corporate and unallocated and other items for operating profit guidance? A: The corporate and unallocated items are trending towards the higher end of the range. This is partly due to G&A efficiencies observed in Q1, as corporate costs include enterprise governance and Solventum transition agreements. Spin-related items are mainly a matter of timing between Q1 and Q2.

A: The largest customer represented **89%** of **Cirrus Logic's** fiscal year '25 revenue. Management believes there was a very limited, non-material pull-forward of shipments into the March quarter by some customers to gain additional inventory ahead of anticipated tariffs, but this was not significant as the tariffs were announced after the quarter ended.
* Q from Gary Mobley - Loop Capital: What is the progress report on your PC-related traction now that the fiscal year has ended, and what is its materiality for fiscal year '25 and the current fiscal year? A: The company is very pleased with its PC-related progress. For fiscal '25, revenue was in the **low tens of millions of dollars** as previously indicated.
