# Analyst Q&A Synthesis

* **Tariff Impact and Mitigation Strategies for Subcomponents:** Management across several companies, including **Fujikura** (Telecommunication Systems components), **Amphenol** (interconnects), **NOK Corporation** (FPC and other electronics), and **AT & S** (PCBs, IC substrates), acknowledged tariff concerns. **Fujikura** quantified a JPY5.6B impact. **Amphenol** expressed confidence in its decentralized model to manage pricing and mitigation with customers. **NOK Corporation and Nanya** discussed passing on costs or monitoring broader economic fallout, while **AT & S** worried about indirect volume impacts.

* **Demand Outlook and Sustainability for AI-related Components (Connectors, Optical, Substrates):** **Amphenol** management conveyed strong conviction in sustained growth for its IT datacom interconnects due to AI’s interconnect intensity. **Fujikura** anticipates ongoing AI-driven demand for its optical fibers, SWR, and ferrules, though it remains cautious in its longer-term data center market forecasts. **Nanya** discussed R&D in specialized DRAM for AI, indicating a future role for memory as a key electrical building block in AI systems.

* **Capacity Expansion and Utilization for Component Manufacturing:** **Fujikura** management confirmed considerations for new optical fiber and SWR manufacturing facilities in Japan to meet demand. **Murata** reported maintaining MLCC (capacitor) utilization around 85-90%. **AT & S** stated its Chongqing plant (likely for PCBs/substrates) utilization is around 60-plus percent. **Nanya** indicated DRAM capacity utilization was around 90% in Q1.

* **Market Conditions for Specific Electronic Components (MLCCs, FPCs, High-Frequency Modules):** **Murata** management highlighted strong order intake and easing price declines for MLCCs (capacitors). However, they foresee a significant downturn for their High-Frequency Device and Communications Module business due to changes in customer product architectures. **NOK Corporation** management linked shortfalls in its electronic components business (which includes FPC) to slower-than-expected automobile production and EV battery growth.

* **Supply Chain Resilience and Financial Stability for Component Suppliers:** While not a direct, universal Q&A theme, **Fujikura**’s discussion on a new Morocco facility (for WTC/ automotive wiring, relevant to broader supply strategy) and **Amphenol**’s emphasis on its global operational footprint (from GSSM, supporting resilience for interconnects) were noted. **AT & S** addressed questions on refinancing and liquidity, crucial for sustaining its PCB and IC substrate supply operations amidst significant capital investments and debt.
