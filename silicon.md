# Analyst Q&A Synthesis

* **Tariff Impact and Geopolitical Risk Mitigation:** Management across multiple companies (**NXP, Texas Instruments, STMicroelectronics, Samsung Electronics**) acknowledged significant uncertainty due to tariffs. Strategies include monitoring policies, diversifying manufacturing footprints (e.g., **STMicroelectronics**’s China-for-China and moves to Europe/ Singapore; **Texas Instruments**’s dual-source manufacturing), and working closely with customers. Some, like **Analog and Parade Technologies**, noted short-term pull-in effects, while **Renesas Electronics** adopted a conservative guidance. **TSMC** stated it is not involved in tariff negotiations.

* **AI Demand and Advanced Technology Capacity:** **TSMC** confirmed it is doubling CoWoS (Chip on Wafer on Substrate) advanced packaging capacity, which remains fully loaded, and expects strong AI momentum into 2026. They are expanding in Arizona due to strong customer AI demand. **Samsung Electronics** expects HBM sales to recover and contribute to topline from Q2, driven by AI server demand.

* **Inventory Outlook and Management:** Companies reported varied inventory situations. **Analog** is currently undershipping end demand but expects to align shipments in Q3. **STMicroelectronics** acknowledged high inventory levels (167 days) but expects reductions to start in Q2. **Texas Instruments** noted customers wanting to hold more inventory, contributing to better-than-seasonal Q2 guidance. **Renesas Electronics** is maintaining lean channel inventory.

* **Capital Expenditure and Foundry/Fab Utilization:** **TSMC** reiterated significant Capex for advanced nodes and overseas expansion (Arizona). **STMicroelectronics**’s CapEx is focused on its manufacturing footprint reshaping. **NXP** reported internal fab utilization in the low 70% range. **Samsung Electronics**’s Foundry business suffered from low utilization due to weak demand from major customers, but a recovery is anticipated in the second half.

* **Specific Semiconductor Segment Demand (Automotive, Industrial, HBM, High-Speed Connectivity):** **Analog** saw automotive pull-ins due to tariffs. **NXP** views Q2 as a turning point for its automotive segment. **Texas Instruments** highlighted continued strengthening in the industrial market. **Samsung Electronics** expects HBM sales to recover gradually. **Parade Technologies** sees its USB4 products as a leading high-speed contributor and expects ARPC (AI PC) to drive demand.

* **Supply Chain Resilience and Sourcing Strategies:** **Analog** secured additional 300mm capacity at **TSMC**’s Japan fab. **Cirrus Logic** is diversifying its supply chain geographically. **STMicroelectronics** is adjusting its manufacturing footprint globally. **Texas Instruments** emphasized its dual-source manufacturing for supply dependability. **NXP** highlighted its European company positioning as advantageous in China while complying with U.S. rules.
