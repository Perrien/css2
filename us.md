# CQ1â€™25 Earnings Highlights

* **Minimal Immediate Impact, Significant Future Uncertainty:** The vast majority of companies reported minimal direct financial impact from tariffs in CQ1 2025, often due to existing inventory or the recent enactment of tariffs. However, there is widespread and significant uncertainty regarding future impacts, particularly for the second half of 2025, with many companies citing fluid trade policies and potential macroeconomic slowdowns.

* **Supply Chain Diversification as a Primary Defense:** Supply chain adjustments and diversification emerged as the most prevalent mitigation strategy. Companies are actively shifting production locations (e.g., out of China to Southeast Asia, Mexico, or the US), qualifying alternative suppliers, and leveraging global manufacturing footprints to reduce tariff exposure and enhance resilience.

* **Anticipated Cost Increases and Pricing Actions:** Many companies anticipate increased costs due to tariffs. While some are absorbing initial minor impacts, a common strategy is to pass through tariff-related costs to customers via price increases, surcharges, or contractual mechanisms, though the ability to do so varies.

* **Demand Pull-Ins and Pull-Backs Observed:** Several companies, particularly in the semiconductor and electronics sectors (e.g., Intel Corporation, Power Integrations, Inc., Alpha and Omega Semiconductor Limited), noted customer order pull-ins in CQ1 2025 in anticipation of tariffs. Conversely, some, like Celanese Corporation and Trinseo PLC, observed or anticipate demand pull-backs in certain segments due to tariff-related uncertainty.

* **Significant Financial Headwinds for Some:** While many project minimal net impact after mitigation, a few companies, like 3M Company (projecting a $0.20 to $0.40 EPS headwind after mitigation in 2025) and ITT Inc. (anticipating $50M-$60M tariff cost impact before mitigation for the rest of 2025), highlighted potentially significant net financial headwinds.

* **Corning Incorporated:** Leveraging its U.S. manufacturing footprint to meet increasing demand for U.S.-sourced solar products, driven partly by trade actions, aligning with its philosophy of locating manufacturing close to customers.

* **Amkor Technology, Inc:** Mentions expanding its geographic footprint as part of its long-term strategy to navigate market dynamics, including trade restrictions, though largely unaffected directly due to operating in free trade zones. 

### Pricing Adjustments 
Passing on increased costs due to tariffs is a frequently mentioned strategy, though its feasibility varies depending on market conditions and pricing power.

* **Amphenol Corporation:** Anticipates a "slight impact on pricing" in CQ2 2025 and will work with customers to pass on pricing impacts where necessary.

* **Vishay Intertechnology, Inc:** Explicitly stated they are passing through additional tariff costs to customers via "adders," resulting in approximately zero gross profit impact but a negative gross margin impact (estimated 30 basis points for Q2).

* **Viavi Solutions Inc:** Is passing on tariff costs to customers for new and unconfirmed orders, though absorbing approximately $3 million in tariff costs in Fiscal Q4 2025 on previously committed orders. 

### Inventory Management 
Adjusting inventory levels is another tactic companies are using, either building up stock ahead of anticipated tariffs or managing inventory tightly in response to uncertainty.

* **3M Company:** Noted it carries 90 days of inventory, which helped minimize direct tariff cost impact in CQ1 2025 as most tariffs were recently enacted.

* **Power Integrations, Inc:** Views its low channel inventories as a potential cushion against a trade-related downturn.

* **Diodes Incorporated:** Emphasized the need to maintain inventory/WIP availability to support customers who are dynamically changing their build locations in response to tariffs. 

### Operational Efficiency & Cost Control 
Companies are focusing on internal cost reduction and operational efficiency to help offset tariff-related cost increases and manage market uncertainty.

* **Celanese Corporation:** Pursuing aggressive cost reduction and prepared to reduce plant operating rates in response to potential demand declines.

* **Lattice Semiconductor Corporation:** Focusing on cost controls and increased operational efficiency while preparing for multiple scenarios.

* **Synaptics Incorporated and SiTime Corporation:** Both emphasized focusing on areas within their control, such as technology roadmaps, growth initiatives, customer relationships, and cost discipline, while monitoring the evolving landscape.

# Broader US Market Confirmation & Additional Insights 
While the preceding sections detailed tariff impacts and strategies for our suppliers, the below section focuses on broader market research covering most large public US headquartered companies. 

### Widespread Impact and Market Sentiment 
The concern over tariffs and trade uncertainty is virtually universal among large US companies.

* **Unprecedented Discourse:** FactSet data shows 411 S&P 500 companies (91% of calls) cited "tariff" or "tariffs" in Q1 2025 earnings calls, the highest in a decade. Similarly, 381 S&P 500 companies (84% of calls) mentioned "uncertainty". This highlights that the issue is at the forefront of C-suite concerns across nearly every major sector.

* **Pervasive Caution:** The Duke Fuqua CFO Survey for Q1 2025 indicated that nearly a third of 400 responding firms explicitly cited trade policy or tariff concerns. This pervasive anxiety, even amidst strong individual company performance, emphasizes the detrimental effect of unpredictability itself.

* **Quantifiable Financial Headwinds:** Beyond the companies previously analyzed, large players are reporting significant impacts. The Yale Budget Lab projects a 1.7% increase in overall consumer prices (short-run) and a 0.7 percentage point reduction in U.S. Real GDP growth for calendar year 2025 due to tariffs. Retailers like Walmart (WMT) have stated they cannot absorb all tariff costs and prices will likely rise for certain goods.

* **Sector Exposure:** While pervasive, impacts are most pronounced in sectors with complex global supply chains or reliance on imported goods, including Automotive, Retail, Technology, Industrials, Manufacturing, and Energy/Utilities/Resources. 

### Confirmation of Strategies & Additional Market-Wide Approaches 
The mitigation strategies observed in our suppliers are broadly adopted across the US market, with some additional nuances gaining prominence.

* **Supply Chain Diversification ("China + 1"):** This is a dominant response, with nearly 30% of firms planning to diversify supply chains. Companies like Apple (AAPL) are actively shifting iPhone production to India and other products to Vietnam. ON Semiconductor (ON) highlights its flexible, geographically diversified supply chain across 19 internal facilities. This is driving shifts in global shipping patterns, as evidenced by Global Ship Lease (GSL) noting increased volumes in smaller trade lanes serving Southeast Asian countries.

* **Onshoring/Reshoring/Nearshoring:** This strategy is widely considered, with 35% of companies considering or implementing it. USA Rare Earths is making significant investments to build a domestic supply chain for critical minerals. General Motors (GM) is increasing U.S. sourcing and leveraging domestic production. Nearshoring to Mexico is frequently cited as a viable option, particularly for manufacturing.

* **Technology Adoption (AI/Automation):** Companies are increasingly using AI and automation to navigate trade complexities. A Q1 2025 poll revealed 98% of U.S.-based supply chain leaders reported integrating AI, including for trade lane analysis, visibility, and compliance automation. Some estimates suggest AI could reduce logistics costs by up to 15%.

* **Leveraging Trade Mechanisms (Bonded Warehousing & FTZs):** There's a significant uptick in the use of these mechanisms to defer or reduce tariff payments. Search traffic for these facilities surged by over 150%. 34% of companies are using or considering duty deferral via FTZs/TIBs. Utilities like Dominion Energy (D) are factoring significant tariff costs into large capital projects but leveraging existing material purchases to maintain supply chain integrity.

* **Alternative Market Focus:** Companies are actively leveraging global footprints to increase sales in less-tariffed regions. Albemarle (ALB) is using its global presence to increase sales in lower-tariff countries. First Solar (FSLR) is pivoting its India-based production to the domestic Indian market in response to U.S. uncertainties.

* **Financial Hedging:** US multinational corporations are notably lengthening the duration of their FX hedges (from short-dated to two-to-five-year tenors) in direct response to increased FX market volatility triggered by tariff announcements. Companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) have reported significant tariff impacts but maintained overall guidance, likely supported by financial risk management strategies.

* **Renegotiating Supplier Contracts:** 52% of companies surveyed by Thomson Reuters are considering or renegotiating supplier contracts to share tariff burdens. Companies like Moog Inc. (MOG.A) are engaging in supplier negotiations for cost sharing and price stability.

* **Legal Reclassification & Customs Optimization:** Ensuring correct product classification and leveraging trade mechanisms is crucial. Honeywell (HON) successfully challenged a classification in court. This drives demand for specialized trade expertise.

* **Elevated Government Affairs & Compliance:** Companies like Stellantis (STLA) and General Motors (GM) are actively engaging with governments on tariff policy, highlighting the increased importance of government affairs and robust trade compliance expertise. 

### Future Outlook and Strategic Adaptations 
The broader market anticipates tariffs as a persistent feature, driving fundamental strategic shifts beyond short-term adjustments.

* **"New Normal" of Trade Friction:** Economic forecasts predict a "new normal" with elevated effective U.S. tariff rates. This long-term expectation is underscored by companies making significant, structural investments in supply chain reconfiguration, rather than temporary fixes. Companies like First Solar (FSLR) have significantly reduced guidance and are considering idling facilities, reflecting anticipation of enduring challenges.

* **Shift to Resilience over Pure Efficiency:** The prolonged uncertainty is pushing companies to prioritize supply chain resilience and predictability over absolute lowest unit cost. This means accepting potentially higher baseline operational costs in exchange for greater stability and reduced vulnerability to shocks.

* **Emerging Strategic Paradigms:** This shift manifests in Supply Chain Regionalization, a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Focus in procurement, and an Elevated Geopolitical Risk Assessment integrated into core strategy. Utility companies like Xcel Energy (XEL) and Entergy (ETR) are factoring tariff impacts into long-term capital plans and developing alternative supply sourcing strategies, demonstrating this long-term adaptation. 

This broader view confirms that the challenges and strategic responses observed within our suppliers are indicative of larger, systemic shifts in the US market, driven by a persistent and unpredictable tariff environment.
